Combinators for drawing 2D shapes and images in Haskell (using OpenGL)

* Summary: this module is a functional wrapper around OpenGL, so you don't have to go into the deep, dark world of imperative stateful programming just to draw stuff. It supports 2D only (for now), with support drawing geometry, images, and text.
